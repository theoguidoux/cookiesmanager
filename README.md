## Demo

Navigate to the [demo](https://github.com/theoguidoux/cookiesmanager/tree/main/demo) 
folder in the repo to run a quick docker-compose
demonstration of this plugin. It includes additional information on
how to start and use the demo.

The demo also illustrates how the plugin can be loaded in a traefik
docker image and used without relying on the traefik Pilot. For more
information about packaging plugins in an image see

## Usage

Add the plugin in your static configuration

```yaml
# Static configuration
experimental:
  plugins:
    cookiesmanager:
      moduleName: github.com/theoguidoux/cookiesmanager
      version: "0.0.1"
```

Use the plugin in your dynamic configuration like this

```yaml
# Dynamic configuration

http:
  routers:
    my-router:
      rule: host(`demo.localhost`)
      service: service-foo
      entryPoints:
        - web
      middlewares:
        - cookiesmanager

  services:
   service-foo:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://127.0.0.1:5000
  
  middlewares:
    cookiesmanager:
      plugin:
        cookiesmanager:
          adder:
            - name: cookie1
              value: "foo=bar"
            - name: "SameSite"
              value: "none"
          remover:
            - name: "cookie2"
              value: "foo=bar"
```

The middleware defined above would make it so that requests to `service-foo` 
have `cookie1` containing `foo=bar`, `SameSite` containing `none` and `cookie2` not containing `foo=bar`.
